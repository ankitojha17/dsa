Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s

class Solution(object):
    def mergeAlternately(self, word1, word2):
        merged = []
        i = 0
        j = 0
        while i < len(word1) or j < len(word2):
            if i < len(word1):
                merged.append(word1[i])
                i += 1
            if j < len(word2):
                merged.append(word2[j])
                j += 1
        print(merged)
        # return .join(merged)
        return ''.join(merged)
