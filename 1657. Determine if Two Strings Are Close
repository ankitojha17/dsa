Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
Explanation: You can attain word2 from word1 in 2 operations.
Apply Operation 1: "abc" -> "acb"
Apply Operation 1: "acb" -> "bca"
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to attain word2 from word1, or vice versa, in any number of operations.

class Solution:
    def closeStrings(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
        if set(word1) != set(word2):
            return False
        count1 = {}
        count2 = {}
        for char in word1:
            if char in count1:
                count1[char] += 1
            else:
                count1[char] = 1
        for char in word2:
            if char in count2:
                 count2[char] += 1
            else:
                 count2[char] = 1
        return sorted(count1.values()) == sorted(count2.values())
